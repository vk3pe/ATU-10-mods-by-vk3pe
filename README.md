# ATU-10-mods-by-vk3pe

ATU-10 is a QRP ATU by N7DDC, modified by vk3pe.

N7DDC's QRP ATU-10 is based on his other work of the ATU-100 but uses latching relays for lower power consumption.
Initially an ATU-10 was built by me from N7DDC's Gerber files, but it became apparent that the two PIC devcies were difficult to solder and more to the point, were, in this day of component shortages, very diffcult to buy.
A schematic was not available so I traced the original PCB to make my own schematic but changed the PIC devices (PIC16F1454 and PIC16F18877) to a larger easier to solder footprint, but actually still available from a number of suppliers.

Boards were ordered and assembled and tested, a small problem was found in my scheamtic tracing but the board was updated and built.  I actually built two of these boards and both seem to work as well as the original, by N7DDC.

Initial Gerbers were for smd parts of 0603 footpint but a later version V1.3x that I made, uses easier to solder 0805 parts in place of the 0603'.

Currently (Feb 2022) Kees K5BCQ, has available a small batch of ATU-10 PCB's made from my Gerber files.
