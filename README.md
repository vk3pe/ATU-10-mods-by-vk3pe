# ATU-10-mods-by-vk3pe

ATU-10 is a QRP ATU, modified by vk3pe
N7DDC's QRP ATU-10 is based on his other work of the ATU-100 but uses latching relays for lower power consumption.
The ATU-10 was built by me from his Gerber files but it became apparent that the two PIC devcies were difficult to solder and more to the point, were, in this day of component shortages, very diffcult to buy.
A schematic was not available so I traced the original PCB to make my own schematic but chnaged the PIC devices (PIC16F1454 and PIC16F18877) to a lrger easier to solder but actually still available from a number of suppliers.

Boards were ordered and assembled and tested, a small problem was found in my scheamtic tracing but the board was updated and built.  I actually built two of these boards and both seem to work as well as the original, by N7DDC.

I will release Gerber files for the PCB soon.
